# PilotCareTrans Net: An EEG Data-Driven Transformer for Pilot Health Monitoring

## Overview

**PilotCareTrans Net** is a Transformer-based model developed to monitor the cognitive health of aviation pilots using EEG data. This project aims to improve decision-making in health interventions by leveraging EEG data to predict potential cognitive overload, fatigue, or stress in pilots during training or real-world scenarios. The model integrates dynamic attention mechanisms and temporal convolution layers to capture complex temporal dynamics in EEG signals, ensuring timely and effective health interventions.

## Background

In high-stakes environments like aviation, monitoring the mental and cognitive state of pilots is crucial for ensuring safety and performance. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data provides a window into brain activity, helping detect potential cognitive and psychological issues such as fatigue, stress, or overload. **PilotCareTrans Net** is designed to analyze these EEG signals and provide real-time predictions, aiding in the prevention of accidents and promoting pilot well-being.

## Objectives

- Develop a Transformer-based model tailored for EEG data analysis to monitor pilot health.
- Predict key cognitive states such as stress, fatigue, and cognitive overload using EEG data.
- Enhance pilot training by providing real-time feedback on cognitive health.
- Optimize decision-making in health interventions based on EEG signal analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Collect EEG data from publicly available datasets such as MODA, STEW, SJTU Emotion EEG, and Sleep-EDF.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the EEG signals, including noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation.
3. **Modeling**: Implement a Transformer-based model with dynamic attention mechanisms and temporal convolution layers to predict cognitive states from EEG data.
4. **Evaluation**: Test and evaluate the model's performance across multiple datasets.
5. **Recommendations**: Use the model's predictions to provide actionable insights for improving pilot training and cognitive health monitoring.
